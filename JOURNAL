July 3rd - 8 hours
- made the decision for the osu!Pad, a player's best friend when playing osu!
- created a repository for osu!Pad
- downloaded and immediately started using KiCAD, drawing up my schematic and navigating the pcb builder. i luckily had a little experience designing PCBs in Fusion 360 beforehand, so figuring out how to use KiCAD wasn't tooooo bad...

- downloaded relevant footprint libraries, symbols, and models.

- theorized and set up my pcb board layout using the keyboard layout editor, considering an ergonomic and efficient layout for the player to navigate osu!
- i probably should have used edgecut before I wired things together, because i ended up having to completely rewire the schematic when i realized the usb-c port should be at the edge asjdfhasfkjshdkfasjfhdjkh

- opened up fusion and started working out the bottom case for the pcb
- unlike the pcb schematic editor, i genuinely had zero experience with 3d design in fusion, so figuring out the program was... definitely interesting!
- but after following the hackpad guide to the best of my ability, as well as guidance from my friend, i proudly ended up with the design for my bottom case

- created the top case for the pcb
- wasn't initially as annoying as the bottom case, but still spent considerable time trying to figure out the measuring tool to get precise measurements in both KiCAD and fusion (keybindings and proper technique to maximize precision)
- then i ran into some weird problem with not being able to edit sketch?? probably something to do with my fusion account and randomly losing privileges to some stuff. spent a lot of time trying to figure it out only to find out that restarting fusion was all i needed to do aaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh
- threw in the name of the macropad at the top of the case and called it a day

July 7th - 3 hours
- time to assemble everything together! 
- threw all of the case design files together in fusion
- oh wait... keyswitch holes and the usb-c port were not aligned properly. spent some time adjusting positions and port placement.
- exported as one step file and finished!

July 8th - 3 hours
- wrote the python code for the firmware
- finalizing details and exporting all necessary files
- preparing for submission; organized github repo, cleaned up the md files

Total time spent: 14 hours
