# osu!Pad
This is my design for my highway hackpad, the osu!Pad! I'm using it as the ultimate device to play the rhythm game osu!, comprising of multiple controls the user can use to play and navigate the game using their osu!Pad!
I decided to do this starter project as I found it as an excellent opportunity to familiarize myself with the process of designing PCBs and utilizing CAD software, while still providing myself with an excellent tool I can use to play osu!
